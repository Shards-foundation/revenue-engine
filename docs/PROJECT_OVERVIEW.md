## Revenue Strategies

The system implements two primary revenue strategies, each with distinct product
offerings and fulfillment workflows.

### Strategy 1: AI CopyKit Micro-SaaS

**Value Proposition**: AI-powered copywriting service that generates
high-converting ad creatives, landing page copy, and email sequences for
marketers and founders.

**Products**:

| SKU | Name | Type | Price | Fulfillment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| COPYKIT-MONTHLY | Monthly | Subscription | £49/mo | Notion ad packs |
| COPYKIT-BUNDLE | Funnel Pack | One-time | £199 | Copy within 48h |

**Revenue Mechanism**: Recurring monthly subscriptions provide predictable
revenue, while one-time bundles serve as upsells to increase average order value
(AOV). Automated fulfillment via Notion workspaces ensures scalability.

**Target Market**: Growth marketers, SaaS founders, e-commerce businesses, and
digital agencies.

### Strategy 2: Daily Markets & Trends Briefing

**Value Proposition**: Daily curated briefing combining market data, trending
topics, and contrarian insights, delivered as text, audio, and video.

**Products**:

| SKU | Name | Type | Price | Fulfillment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DAILYBRIEF-MONTHLY | Briefing | Subscription | £15/mo | Email, audio, video |

**Revenue Mechanism**: Low-friction subscription with high retention due to
daily value delivery. Automated content generation using AI reduces operational
costs to near zero.

**Target Market**: Day traders, content creators, startup founders, and
trend-conscious professionals.
